major learning :- getchar() vs scanf()

- getchar(): This function reads a single character from the standard input (usually the keyboard) and returns it as an integer. It does not require a format specifier, and it does not skip any leading whitespace. It's often used in a loop to read multiple characters until a certain condition is met, such as reaching a newline character or the end of file.

- scanf(): This function reads formatted input from the standard input. It requires format specifiers to determine the type and number of input items to read. It can read multiple items at once, and it automatically skips leading whitespace. It's often used to read a line of text or a specific number of items.
